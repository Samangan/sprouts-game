General Drawing Mechanics
=========================
* We need collision detection for the currentEdgeBuffer moving onto itself.
* Allow for mousemove events to complete an edge instead of only allowing mouseup events to terminate the drawing of an edge.


Multiplayer Game Play
=====================
+ Add the concept of players to game.js.
* Implement basic 2 player turn taking for the frontend.
* Create an initial backend server for the game.
